    "# PaddleTransfer\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "PaddleTransfer, a transfer learning tool of PaddlePaddle, provides a variety of algorithms to transfer the knowledge learned from source tasks to target task. It enables users to use the state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms on main-stream model archtechtures.\n",
    "\n",
    "PaddleTransfer provides various transfer learning algorithms, including **MMD(JMLR'12),L2-SP(ICML'18), DELTA(ICLR'19), RIFLE(ICML'20), Co-Tuning(NIPS'20)** and supports many main-stream model archtechtures, including **ResNet, MobileNet and ViT**. With several lines of codes, users can apply these algorithms on our predifined model or their own model easily.\n",

    "```\n",
    "python finetune.py --name [experiment_name] --train_dir [path_to_train_dir] --eval_dir [path_to_eval_dir] --model_arch [model_archtechture] --algo [finetune_algorithm] --gpu [device_for_experiment]\n",

    "#### Import dependencies\n",
    "```\n",
    "from paddletransfer.finetuning.img_cls import *\n",
    "```\n",
    "We strongly recommand you to use the model architechtures we provide in **backbones** by following codes.

    "\n",
    "If you want to use your self-defined model, please make sure that the name of layers are consistent with the implementations in [paddle.vision.models](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/tree/release/2.3/python/paddle/vision/models) and your model has two outputs: The first one is the original output of the network and the second one is the features(the intermediate output before average pooling layer and fc layer).\n",
